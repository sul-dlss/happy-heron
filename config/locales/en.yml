  tooltip:
    what_type: Choose the one content type that best describes the overall or primary nature of the work. Click on each content type to view and select terms you may use to further describe the work you are depositing.
    further_types: You have the option to further describe the work you are depositing. If you have chosen "Mixed Materials", you must choose at least two of the additional terms. If you have chosen "Music", you must select at least one term from the shorter list of terms below, but you may enter others from the full list as well (choose "See more options"). If you have chosen "Other", you must enter a word or short phrase to describe the overall nature of the work you are depositing.
    collection:
      name: Enter a name for your collection. This name will serve as the title of the collection in the Stanford Libraries' catalog and will appear on the persistent URLs for all items deposited into this collection. It is not necessary to include the word "Collection" at the end of the title.
      description: Enter an approximately 2-3 sentence description of the works to be included in this collection. You may want to include information on who the creators of the works are/will be, when the works were/will be created, general subject matter of the works, types of works (technical reports, datasets, video archives, etc), and the scholarly value of the content.
      contact_email: Enter one or more valid email addresses where people can write to ask questions about this collection. Consider using a group address where messages will be seen by more than one person and that may be active longer than a single personal email address to ensure that questions are received. Email addresses will appear on your persistent URL page.
      related_link: This section allows you to provide links to other web pages that are related to your collection. These links will display on the PURL page for the collection and on the Stanford Libraries' catalog record. Enter the text to be displayed on the page in the "Link text" box. This entire text will be hyperlinked to the URL you enter in the "URL" box. Examples of content you might consider linking to are key funder websites,  lab or institute websites, or project pages.
      release: As the collection manager, you can decide whether 1) Depositors to this collection are required to make the files on their deposits downloadable as soon as the deposit is completed ("Immediately"), 2) if downloading will be delayed for all Depositors until a certain date ("Delay release until…"), or 3) if Depositors can decide for themselves when downloading of their content will be available ("Depositor selects…"). Note that for all of these options the PURL page is always visible as soon as the deposit is complete and all metadata on the page is visible to anyone.
      access: As the collection manager, you can decide whether 1) Depositors to this collection are required to make the files on their deposits downloadable by anyone in the world ("Everyone"), 2) if downloading of files for all deposits will be restricted to the Stanford community ("Stanford community"), or 3) if Depositors can decide for themselves which of these options to choose ("Depositor selects"). For the "Depositor selects" option, the default option presented to the Depositor will be the "Everyone" option, but they will be able to choose "Stanford community" if they choose.
      doi: As the collection manager, you can decide whether 1) DOIs will be assigned automatically to every deposit in this collection, 2) DOIs will not be assigned to any deposits in this collection, or 3) Depositors can decide for themselves if they would like to have a DOI assigned to their work. We strongly recommend the "Yes" response that will automatically assign DOIs to all works.
      terms: As the collection manager, you can decide whether 1) a specific license  you choose from the list will be mandatory for every deposit to the collection ("Require license for all deposits") or 2) if the Depositors will be able to choose the license they wish to use ("Depositor selects license").  For this second option, you must choose a license from the list to be displayed as the default option for Depositors.
      managers: Managers have the ability to edit the collection description; add and remove other Managers, Reviewers, and Depositors; adjust discovery, access, and license settings for the collection; and edit any content deposited to the collection, including content deposited by others.
      depositors: Depositors are allowed to add works to the collection, but cannot see or edit the works deposited by others.
      reviewers: Reviewers receive notifications of deposits submitted for approval. Reviewers can approve, edit, or return works to Depositors. Reviewers cannot edit collection information or settings or add/remove collection participants.
    work:
      description: Enter a brief description (100 characters max) to help others understand what this file contains. This description will appear on the PURL page next to the name of the file. This description is not required.
      hide_file: Check this box to prevent this file from ever being displayed on the PURL. The file will still be preserved in the Stanford Digital Repository with your deposit, but visitors to your PURL page will not be able to see it or download it. This option is sometimes used for permissions or release forms related to the content, or for other documentation related to the deposit that you would like preserved but that you do not want visible to others. Hidden files should NOT contain any content the University classifies as High-Risk, such as PHI, PII, or social security or credit card numbers.
      title: Enter a descriptive name for your deposit (approx. max of 600 words). This name will serve as the title of the PURL page and of the deposit in the Stanford Libraries' catalog. Please avoid generic titles such as "Dataset for Publication" or "My Honors Thesis" and instead opt for a title that will help users who find your content via an internet search to understand the general content of the work.
      contact_email: Enter one or more valid email addresses where people can write to ask questions about this deposit. Please use an email address that you expect to be functional for many years, if possible. Email addresses will appear on your persistent URL page.
      author: List all individuals or organizations who should be included as authors in the citation for this work. List each individual or organization only once.
      role_term: Choose the role for each individual or organization that best describes their contribution to the work you are depositing.
      first_name:  For individuals, use whatever capitalization the individual would normally use for their name. Middle names or initials may be included after the first name.
      organization: Enter the full name of the organization.
      orcid: An ORCID iD is a persistent digital identifier that distinguishes you from every other researcher. If you don’t have an ORCID iD, you can get one at <a href="https://orcid.org/">https://orcid.org/</a> and then connect it to your Stanford identity at <a href="https://authorize.stanford.edu">https://authorize.stanford.edu</a>. If you choose to supply your ORCID iD, we will use it to retrieve your name information and store both the name and ORCID iD in the metadata for your deposit.
      orcid_name: This is the name we retrieved from ORCID and that will be included in the metadata for this deposit. Editing this name will change it on this deposit only and will not alter your ORCID record. If you need to enter a different ORCID iD, click the trash can icon on the top right.
      contributor:  List any other individuals or organizations that you would like to acknowledge as having played a role in this work, but whom you would not include as an author in the citation. List each individual or organization only once.
      date: This application will automatically record the date that your content is made available on its persistent URL (PURL) page. If you have selected a delayed release date, that release date is the one we will record. Please check the tooltips below for specific information about optional publication and creation dates.
      publication_date: Typically used only for works that were previously published elsewhere, prior to their deposit in the SDR. You cannot enter a future date in this field.
      creation_date: Date or date range when the deposited work was collected, generated, or created. <strong>Unless you are depositing a dataset or content for Stanford University Archives, please do not enter a Creation Date</strong> The "Approximate" option should typically not be used with dates containing a month and/or day.

      keywords: Keywords should reflect significant concepts related to the deposit. As you type, terms will be suggested to you, but free-text entries are also permitted. At least one entry is required. Enter one keyword or phrase per box. Click "Add another keyword" to add each additional term. Click the trash can icon next to the term to remove it. If you would like to enter your department affiliation, please do so under the Contributors section and choose "Department" for the role term.
