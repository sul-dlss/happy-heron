# The HTTP_X_REMOTE_USER variable comes from our Apache config behind a reverse
# proxy, where we can't set or build upon REMOTE_USER. Instead, we set the
# X-Remote-User header and that is translated to the HTTP_X_REMOTE_USER
# environment variable. These are used by the devise-remote-user gem to
# authenticate users.
remote_user_headers:
  - REMOTE_USER
  - HTTP_X_REMOTE_USER
